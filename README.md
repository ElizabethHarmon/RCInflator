This is a copy of the JSFX script created by REAPER forum member RCJacH and modified significantly by forum member Sai'ke to null against Sonnox Inflator in every setting excluding "band split mode" which has yet to be implemented. See the disccusion at https://forum.cockos.com/showthread.php?t=256286. My contributions were to provide test data for analysis as well as match the slider limits and defaults to the original plugin.
